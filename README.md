Code are developed by using DeepXDE, a python package build by Lu and his team. Really appreciate for their great work on PINN.
There is an example of PINN for solving Van der Pol equation. 
There are two types of code in folder. One is the regular method for solving Vdp. Anther is about seq2seq method for generate solutions for long time interval.
